### CH7.1 Introduction

Electrical resistivity methods are used extensively in 
- search for suitable groundwater sources
- monitor types of groundwater pollution
- locate subsurface cavities, faults and fissures, permafrost, mine shafts
- mapping out the areal extent of remnants of buried foundations of ancient buildings
- downhole logging

### CH7.2.1 True resistivity

Resistance (R) is proportional to length (L) divided by area (A): R ∝ L /A

This can be written as R = ρL /A, where ρ is the true resistivity

By Ohm’s Law

- ρ = E /J (Ωm)
- ρ = VA/IL (Ωm)

The inverse of resistivity (1/ρ) is conductivity σ 

 units : (S/m) =  (Ω−1 m−1)
